            The full name of UTRA is University of Toronto Robot Association. The association
            has three teams. Mech team build the physical robot. AI team develop the algorithm
            for robots, such as reponse for balls and communication between the agent.
            Control team uses simulation to test the algorithm and functionality of agent. I
            was working in control team and learning how to test a simple agent to walk or kick.
            Later on, I was helping team to design kick strategy.(Adding program Link)

      Engineer Strategy and Practice(ESP) is the first year course to give us a
      systematic way to design things. Our project was to help Horbour Village
      Association to tackle the bike thieves. for a semester, I worked with other
      4 engineer student from different areas. For the design proposal, each of us
      generate a bike-rack design by self. And later on, we vote a best solution by
      functionality and survey for village resident.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Final Design Specification, we gave the detail dimension and cost of bike-rack.
      As well as the installation proccess and so on. I was response for the installation
      proccess, policy requirement and citen formate.
